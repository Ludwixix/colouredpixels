Details
You need to write a program which will produce an image in which each colour occurs exactly once -
- with no repetition and no used colours. Colours are formed by combining a red, green, and blue
component in the range 0..256; your program will need to break each component into 32 steps -- 8,
16,24, .. 256 -- which means you will have 32,768 discrete colours. Your image will therefore need to
be sized to accommodate exactly this number of unique colours -- for example, 256x128px (although
other dimensions are possible).
The result should be aesthetically pleasing (or at least interesting) and should not use any existing
graphics or other files. Your submission will be evaluated in terms of good development practices
followed, cleanliness of code, the elegance of the algorithm you use, and the originality of your
approach.
